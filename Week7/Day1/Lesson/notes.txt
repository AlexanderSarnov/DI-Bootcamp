did an exercise in the previous day folder

lesson about organizing the server side files and functions.

/**
 * server
 * |_ config - connection to database
 * |_ models - schema for products (queries to db)
 * |_ controllers - handle requests and interact with models (request,response)
 * |_ routes - define endpoints (api endpoints)(route for api)
 * |_ middlewares - funcitons that are getting requests and responses and continue the logic in the controller or change login in the middleware.
 */


Inside routers
we define files as products.router.js, users.router.js --> different apis for different stuff.
if we need to add a feature to products.router.js - we go there. We separate things in our server!

! Connect to the neon database (coud database) - sign up and there we can create an instance of the database.
