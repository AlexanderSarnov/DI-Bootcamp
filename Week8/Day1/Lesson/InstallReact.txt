There are many ways to start React, but recommended is to go with Vite (vitejs.dev)

PS C:\Users\alexa\OneDrive\Documents\WebDev\DI\DI-Bootcamp\Week8\Day1\Lesson> npm create vite@latest
Need to install the following packages:
create-vite@5.5.2
Ok to proceed? (y) y


> npx
> create-vite

√ Project name: ... day1-vite
√ Select a framework: » React
√ Select a variant: » JavaScript

Scaffolding project in C:\Users\alexa\OneDrive\Documents\WebDev\DI\DI-Bootcamp\Week8\Day1\Lesson\day1-vite...

Done. Now run:

  cd day1-vite
  npm install
  npm run dev

PS C:\Users\alexa\OneDrive\Documents\WebDev\DI\DI-Bootcamp\Week8\Day1\Lesson>

At some point will need to use arrow keys to choose the options from the list to install React and JS but in general it allows to have a lot faster React installation.

PS C:\Users\alexa\OneDrive\Documents\WebDev\DI\DI-Bootcamp\Week8\Day1\Lesson> cd day1-vite
PS C:\Users\alexa\OneDrive\Documents\WebDev\DI\DI-Bootcamp\Week8\Day1\Lesson\day1-vite> npm install

Now on the link we are running Vite + React application.

Styling can be done with libraries: mui (material ui - known to be reliable), bootstrap, tailwind, tachyons (similar to bootstrap - a constructor of shorthand classes, very nice and fast to style the div)
