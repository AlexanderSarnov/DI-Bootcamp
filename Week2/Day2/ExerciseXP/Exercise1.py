1. Create a set called my_fav_numbers with all your favorites numbers.

2. Add two new numbers to the set.

3. Remove the last number.

4. Create a set called friend_fav_numbers with your friendâ€™s favorites numbers.

5. Concatenate my_fav_numbers and friend_fav_numbers to a new variable called our_fav_numbers.
