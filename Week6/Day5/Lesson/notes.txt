express.js - is web application server framework for web applications.

standard server framework for node.js

used to deverlope an application that can handle multiple requests at once (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete.

Server - Client communication
Client sends requests to the server
Server receives requests and evaluates it accordingly
Server sends response to the Client

HTTP is the only way to send requests and get responses.

We will use the express server as an example (developing a server is a big deal and will take years for a single person to accomplish)
