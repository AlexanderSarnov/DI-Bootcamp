Create A React App
In order to learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment on your computer.

The "create-react-app" is an officially supported way to create React applications.

According to the documentation:

Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single page application in React.

What Is Create React App ?
Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack.

Create A Project
If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application.

The create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.

Run this command to create a React application named blog:
C:\Users\Your Name>npx create-react-app blog


Note: npx on the first line is not a typo — it’s a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+

Run this command to move to the blog directory:
C:\Users\Your Name>cd blog


Run this command to execute the React application blog:
C:\Users\Your Name\myfirstreact>npm start


A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.
